moving on bootstap

need to try and keep time when sampling 
           (Process/model_object,  interp_raw_obs_path_to_uniform_grid())

after this, check rho and buoyancy grads have been sampled ok
           (Process/model_object)

the get bootstrap calc and plotting going
           (Plot/plot_bootstrap_glider_sampling)
